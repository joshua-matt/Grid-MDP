# Grid-MDP
An environment for creating and solving deterministic grid-world MDPs which I wrote to better understand MDPs for my Spring 2021 Artificial Intelligence class. The project contains a `GridMDP` class which accepts arguments controlling the size, default transition reward, and special reward/punishment squares. It also contains an `Agent` class which includes value and policy iteration methods for solving the given MDP.
